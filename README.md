# **Interplanetary Weight Converter**

The Interplanetary Weight Converter program converts a weight to its equivalent weight to other solar system planets. This training project, prepared by [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-c-plus-plus), has been an invaluable exercise in applying the knowledge I learned in learning to use conditional statements using C++.

## Project Prompt

Little Mac is an interplanetary space boxer, who is trying to win championship belts for various weight categories on other planets within the solar system.

Write a `space.cpp` program that helps him keep track of his target weight by:

- It should ask him what his earth weight is.
- Ask him to enter a number for the planet he wants to fight on.
- It should then compute his weight on the destination planet.

Here is the table of conversion:

| # |  Planet | Relative Gravity |
|:-:|:-------:|:----------------:|
| 1 | Mercury | 0.38             |
| 2 | Venus   | 0.91             |
| 3 | Mars    | 0.38             |
| 4 | Jupiter | 2.34             |
| 5 | Saturn  | 1.06             |
| 6 | Uranus  | 0.92             |
| 7 | Neptune | 1.19             |

## Technologies

- C++

## Setup

Generally, you would want to compile and execute the program locally. To do that:

1. Download `space.cpp`.
2. Open the terminal or command line and navigate to the directory where the downloaded file resides.
3. Run the following commands to compile and execute the program:

```git
g++ space.cpp -o space
./space
```
